# How to Fix Serial Number Adobe Photoshop CS3 Trial Expired Error
 
If you are using Adobe Photoshop CS3 and you encounter a trial expired error, you may be wondering how to fix it. There are several possible solutions that you can try, depending on your situation. Here are some of them:
 
- **Solution 1: Sign out and sign back in.** Launch the Creative Cloud desktop app. Click the profile icon in the upper-right corner of the app and click Sign Out. Sign back in with the account or profile associated with your subscription. Learn more[^1^].
- **Solution 2: Sign in with a different profile.** Adobe profiles are set up when you have multiple Adobe plans (including at least one business plan) associated with the same email address. If you choose a profile that does not have the licences, you see a trial prompt. Launch the Creative Cloud desktop app. Click the profile icon in the upper-right corner of the app and click Sign Out. Sign back in with the profile associated with your subscription. Learn more on managing Adobe profiles[^1^].
- **Solution 3: Launch product from Creative Cloud desktop app.** Exit the Adobe application that shows the trial prompt. From the File menu, select Exit. Launch the application from the Creative Cloud desktop app.
- **Solution 4: Remove Adobe-related entries from the hosts file.** If the Operating System's hosts file is incorrectly configured (hosts files map host names to IP addresses), your computer can have trouble connecting to Adobe's licensing servers. To solve this issue, remove Adobe-related entries from the hosts file. Learn more[^1^].
- **Solution 5: Clear the cached licensing information.** Rename the SLCache folder to SLCache-old: Windows: \\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Adobe macOS: System/Library/Application Support/Adobe Launch an Adobe application. For Windows, right-click the Creative Cloud product and click Run As Administrator. For macOS, go to the Applications folder and double-click the product[^1^].
- **Solution 6: Delete the sign-in information.** Corrupted sign-in information can get stuck in our database files. To clean it up, quit or exit all Adobe applications, and delete the opm.db file. Windows: \\Users\\<user name="">\\AppData\\Local\\Adobe\\OOBE macOS: /Users/<user name="">/Library/Application Support/Adobe/OOBE[^1^].</user></user>
- **Solution 7: Get a new serial number and installer.**If none of the above solutions work, you may need to get a new serial number and installer so you can reinstall CS3 applications successfully. These special versions do not require activation. To get them, follow these steps[^3^]:
