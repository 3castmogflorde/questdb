# How to Use Diablo 2 Median XL Maphack 1.12
 
Diablo 2 Median XL is a popular mod for the classic action RPG that adds new skills, items, quests, and challenges. But if you want to explore the vast maps of Sanctuary without getting lost or missing any secrets, you might want to use a maphack. A maphack is a tool that reveals the entire map of the current area, showing you where the waypoints, shrines, chests, monsters, and bosses are.

However, not all maphacks are safe or allowed on Median XL. Some maphacks can cause crashes, errors, or bans from the official server. That's why you need to use the only maphack that is approved by the Median XL team: D2MR.
 
D2MR is a simple and lightweight maphack that works with Median XL 1.12 and later versions. It does not modify any game files or memory addresses, so it does not interfere with the mod's features or anti-cheat system. It also has a toggle option, so you can turn it on or off whenever you want.
 
Here's how to use Diablo 2 Median XL Maphack 1.12:
 
1. Download D2MR from [this forum post](https://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?t=892) or [this website](https://www.elitegrounds.net/d2Hacks.html). Make sure you download the version that matches your game version (1.12 or later).
2. Extract the D2MR.exe file to your Diablo 2 folder.
3. Run D2MR.exe as an administrator.
4. Launch Diablo 2 Median XL and join a game.
5. Press F5 to reveal the map of the current area. Press F5 again to hide it.
6. Enjoy exploring the world of Median XL with ease!

Note: D2MR is the only maphack that is allowed on Median XL's official server, The Sin War. Using any other maphack will result in a ban. You can read more about the server rules [here](https://tsw.vn.cz/rules/).

But why would you want to use a maphack in Diablo 2 Median XL? What are the benefits of seeing the whole map at once? Well, there are several reasons why a maphack can enhance your gaming experience:

- You can save time and avoid frustration by finding the shortest path to your destination, whether it's a quest objective, a waypoint, a shrine, or a boss.
- You can plan your strategy and tactics better by knowing where the enemies and hazards are, and how to avoid or confront them.
- You can discover hidden secrets and easter eggs that you might otherwise miss, such as special chests, unique monsters, or rare items.
- You can optimize your loot and experience by clearing every area and killing every monster, without leaving any corner unexplored.
- You can have more fun and challenge by trying different builds and playstyles, without worrying about getting lost or stuck.

Of course, using a maphack is not mandatory or essential for playing Diablo 2 Median XL. Some players might prefer to explore the maps on their own, and enjoy the element of surprise and discovery. Others might consider using a maphack as cheating or unfair. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide how you want to play the game and what makes it fun for you.
