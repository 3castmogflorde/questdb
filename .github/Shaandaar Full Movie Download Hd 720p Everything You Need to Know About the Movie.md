Shaandaar is considered to be one of the most expensive Bollywood films ever made, with a production cost of 칙축췇75 crore (US$11 million). The film was shot in various locations in India and the United Kingdom, including Leeds Castle, London Eye, Hyde Park and Blenheim Palace. The film also featured several cameo appearances by celebrities such as Karan Johar, Anil Kapoor, Shah Rukh Khan and Ranveer Singh.
 
Shaandaar received a mixed response from the audience as well. Some viewers enjoyed the film for its light-hearted humor, chemistry between the lead actors and catchy songs, while others found the film to be boring, illogical and clich츾춸d. The film also faced controversy for its portrayal of a Sikh character (played by Akshay Kumar), who was accused of being stereotypical and offensive by some Sikh groups.
 
Despite its poor performance at the box office, Shaandaar won several awards and nominations at various ceremonies. The film won two awards at the Stardust Awards for Best Costume Design and Best Music Director. The film also received nominations at the Filmfare Awards, Screen Awards, Zee Cine Awards and IIFA Awards.

Shaandaar is a film that tried to be a fun and romantic comedy, but failed to impress the critics and the audience. The film had a promising star cast, a talented director and a lavish budget, but lacked a strong script, a coherent plot and a memorable climax. The film is not a complete disaster, as it has some moments of entertainment, charm and beauty, but it is not a film that you would want to watch again and again.
 
If you are looking for a film that will make you laugh, cry and fall in love, Shaandaar is not the one for you. You can watch it once if you are curious or a fan of the actors, but don't expect too much from it. Shaandaar is a film that could have been great, but ended up being mediocre.
