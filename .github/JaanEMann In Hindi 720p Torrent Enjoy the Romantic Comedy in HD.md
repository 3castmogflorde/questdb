One of the advantages of Moldflow Insight 2019 is that it can be installed and used as a portable application, meaning that you do not need to install it on your computer or have administrator privileges. You can run it from a removable storage device, such as a USB flash drive, or from a network drive. This can be useful if you need to use the software on different machines or locations, or if you want to avoid modifying your system settings.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install and use Moldflow Insight 2019 portable on Windows operating systems. You will need to have a valid license for the software and an internet connection to activate it.
  
## Step 1: Download the installer
 
The first step is to download the installer file from the Autodesk website. You can find it at [https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/product/moldflow-insight](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/product/moldflow-insight). You will need to sign in with your Autodesk account or create one if you do not have one already. Then, select the version and language of the software that you want to download.
 
The installer comes as a single, compressed, self-extracting shell script file with the name install-workstation-ami2019-RR-NN-glibcGGG.sh, where RR is the sub-release, NN is an Autodesk version number, and GGG is the glibc version required to run the software. The file size is about 2 GB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed.
  
## Step 2: Extract the files
 
The next step is to extract the files from the installer file to a destination folder of your choice. You can use any folder on your removable storage device or network drive, as long as it has enough space (about 4 GB) and you have write access to it. You can also use a folder on your local drive if you prefer.
 
To extract the files, you need to run the installer file with some command-line options. You can do this by opening a command prompt window (press Windows+R and type cmd) and navigating to the folder where you saved the installer file. Then, type the following command:

    sh install-workstation-ami2019-RR-NN-glibcGGG.sh --target <destination folder> --nochown --noexec

where &lt;destination folder&gt; is an absolute path to the folder where you want to extract the files. For example:

    sh install-workstation-ami2019-01-01-glibc2.12.sh --target E:\Moldflow --nochown --noexec

This command will create the destination folder if it does not exist and extract all the files there without triggering the inbuilt shell script installer or changing the ownership of the files. Once this command is executed, the destination folder will contain files with the suffix rpm, such as those below, and some additional shell script install files:
