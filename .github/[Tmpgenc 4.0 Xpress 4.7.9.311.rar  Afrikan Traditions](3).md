TMPGEnc 4.0 XPress is a video encoding software that supports many input and output formats, detailed parameter settings, a fast and precise cut-edit function, video format conversion, compression, material creation and much more. It is the successor to the award-winning TMPGEnc 4.0 XPress, which was released in 2007.
 
One of the features of TMPGEnc 4.0 XPress is that it can handle .rar files, which are compressed archives that contain one or more files. This means that you can encode videos that are stored in .rar files without extracting them first. For example, if you have a file named tmpgenc 4.0 xpress 4.7.9.311.rar, you can simply drag and drop it into the software and start encoding.

You can add transitions, filters, audio tracks, subtitles and other effects to your videos and preview them in real time. You can also use the smart rendering function to speed up the encoding process by re-encoding only the edited parts of your video.
