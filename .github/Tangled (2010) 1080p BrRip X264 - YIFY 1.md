The film tells the story of a young princess named Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore), who has been locked away in a secluded tower for 18 years by her kidnapper and adoptive mother, Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy). Rapunzel's magical long blonde hair has the power to heal and rejuvenate, and Mother Gothel uses it to keep herself young and beautiful. One day, a charming thief named Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi) stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower while fleeing from the royal guards. Rapunzel strikes a deal with Flynn: she will return his stolen satchel, which contains a crown he stole from the palace, if he agrees to take her to see the floating lanterns that are released every year on her birthday. Along the way, they encounter many dangers and adventures, as well as discover their true feelings for each other.
 
Tangled is a delightful and enchanting film that combines humor, romance, action, and music. The animation is stunning and colorful, with realistic details and expressive characters. The voice acting is superb, with Moore and Levi having great chemistry and charisma. The songs are catchy and memorable, composed by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. The film also features a hilarious animal sidekick, a chameleon named Pascal, and a loyal horse named Maximus, who acts more like a dog than a steed.
 
Tangled is one of the best animated films of 2010, and one of the most successful films in Disney's history. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and grossed over $591 million worldwide. It was nominated for several awards, including an Academy Award for Best Original Song for "I See the Light". It also spawned a short film sequel, Tangled Ever After (2012), a television film prequel, Tangled: Before Ever After (2017), and a television series, Tangled: The Series (2017-2020).

## Tangled (2010) 1080p BrRip X264 - YIFY 1: A Comparison
 
Tangled is not the first film adaptation of the Rapunzel fairy tale. In fact, there have been several versions of the story in different media, such as books, comics, television, and video games. Some of the most notable ones are:
 
- Rapunzel (1979), a German animated film directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner.
- Rapunzel (1983), a Japanese anime film directed by Masakazu Higuchi.
- Rapunzel (1990), a British live-action film directed by Gilbert Cates.
- Barbie as Rapunzel (2002), a direct-to-video computer-animated film produced by Mattel.
- Rapunzel: A Tangled Tale (2009), a British live-action film directed by Niall Johnson.
- Shrek Forever After (2010), a computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation, in which Rapunzel is one of the villains.

How does Tangled compare to these other adaptations? Well, Tangled is certainly more modern and original than most of them. It adds many new elements to the story, such as the magical hair, the floating lanterns, the chameleon, and the horse. It also gives more depth and personality to the characters, especially Rapunzel and Flynn. It also has a more humorous and adventurous tone than some of the darker and more serious versions. However, Tangled is not without its flaws. Some critics have pointed out that it deviates too much from the original source material, and that it follows the typical Disney formula of princesses, songs, and happy endings. Some have also argued that it lacks the emotional impact and artistic merit of some of the older and more faithful adaptations.
