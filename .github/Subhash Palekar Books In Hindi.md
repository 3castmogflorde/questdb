Subhash Palekar is not the only farmer who has advocated for natural farming. Another famous proponent of this approach is Masanobu Fukuoka, a Japanese farmer and philosopher who wrote the influential book *The One-Straw Revolution*. Fukuoka's method of natural farming is based on four principles: no tillage, no fertilizer, no pesticides, and no weeding. He believed that nature knows best and that humans should not interfere with its processes.
 
Fukuoka's book has inspired many people around the world to adopt natural farming and to live in harmony with nature. Some of his other books are *The Road Back to Nature*, *Natural Way of Farming*, and *The Sowing Seeds in the Desert*. You can find his books online or in bookstores, or you can visit his website [http://www.onestrawrevolution.net/](http://www.onestrawrevolution.net/) for more information and resources.
 
Natural farming is not only a way of growing food, but also a way of living. It can help us to reduce our environmental impact, improve our health, and reconnect with our true selves. If you are interested in natural farming, you can start by reading Subhash Palekar's and Masanobu Fukuoka's books, and by applying their principles in your own garden or farm. You will be amazed by the results and the benefits of natural farming.
